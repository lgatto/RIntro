{"name":"Rintro","tagline":"An introduction to R for beginners, using microarrays as main thread","body":"\r\nA 1 day `R` introductory course for non-programmers, using\r\nmicroarrays as main thread. Also includes an intro to Bioconductor and\r\nthe `eSet` infrastructure. Initially set up for the\r\n[diXa](http://www.dixa-fp7.eu/dixa-training/dixa-training-agenda/dixa-microarray-training)\r\nMicroarray Analysis using R and Bioconductor training (see tags for\r\nspecific courses). Partially based on the\r\n[Beginners guide to solving biological problems in `R`](http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/gsls/course/gsls-rintro)\r\n(see also [here](http://logic.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/teaching/Rcourse/))\r\ncourse by Robert StojniÄ‡, Rob Foy, John Davey, Laurent Gatto and Ian\r\nRoberts.\r\n\r\n## Slides\r\n\r\nThe [slides](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/RIntro.pdf?raw=true)\r\nprovide a general introduction to [`R`](http://www.r-project.org/) and\r\nthe main data structures. Scripting and plotting is presented by means\r\nof exercises using microarray data as example. Finally,\r\n[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) and the microarray\r\n`eSet`/`ExpressionSet` classes are introduced and compared to the\r\nprevious introductory material and exercises.\r\n\r\n## Exercises\r\n\r\n1. Using `R` interactively and running a script.\r\n2. [Vectors](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-02.md)\r\n3. [How to store microarray data](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-03.md)\r\n  * expression data and meta data\r\n  * matrices, data frames and lists.\r\n4. [A short microarray analysis](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-04.md)\r\n  * reading spreadsheets into `R`\r\n  * saving/loading objects\r\n  * basic plotting\r\n  * `for` loops: counting differentially expressed genes in three\r\n     microarray result data\r\n5. [Another microarray analysis](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-05.md)\r\n  * combining multiple expression matrices and produce a heatmap\r\n  * extracting, parsing and visualising genes of interest\r\n6. [A short Bioconductor data analysis](https://github.com/lgatto/RIntro/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise-06.md)\r\n  * Quality control\r\n  * Exploratory data analysis\r\n\r\n## See also\r\n\r\nSee the [TeachingMaterial](https://github.com/lgatto/TeachingMaterial)\r\nrepository for more material.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis material is licensed under the\r\n[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
